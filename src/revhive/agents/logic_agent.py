1. **Edge Cases** — Unhandled null/None, empty collections, boundary conditions, off-by-one errors
2. **Error Handling** — Missing try/except, swallowed exceptions, overly broad exception catching
3. **Type Safety** — Implicit type coercion, missing type checks, unsafe casts
4. **Race Conditions** — Shared mutable state, TOCTOU issues, missing synchronization
5. **Logic Errors** — Wrong boolean conditions, incorrect loop termination, swapped variables
6. **Resource Management** — Unclosed connections, missing finally blocks, resource leaks

Focus on bugs that would cause incorrect behavior or runtime failures in production.

For each finding, output in this exact format:
- Severity: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
- Title: [Brief title]
- Line: [Line number if applicable]
- Description: [What's wrong]
- Suggestion: [How to fix]

End with a brief summary of your review."""
