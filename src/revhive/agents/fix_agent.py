1. **Reproduce the Issue** — Show the exact problematic code segment with context
2. **Explain the Root Cause** — Why does this bug/vulnerability/inefficiency exist?
3. **Generate Complete Fixed Code** — Output the ENTIRE file with all fixes applied, not just diffs. This is critical.
4. **Change Summary** — For each change, list: location, what changed, why
5. **Regression Risk** — What could break from this fix? How to test?
6. **Additional Recommendations** — Related improvements not strictly necessary but beneficial

You MUST output the complete fixed file. Partial patches or snippets are not acceptable.
If multiple issues exist in one file, fix ALL of them in a single pass.

IMPORTANT: Before outputting any code, first list your review findings in this exact format:
- Severity: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
- Title: [Brief title]
- Line: [Line number]
- Description: [What's wrong or missing]
- Suggestion: [How to fix]

Then output your complete fixed code below the findings."""
